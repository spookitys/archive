                <h3>Indictment</h3>
                    <p>Notice of Induction: You have been formally accepted into ARCHIVE. Your recruitment reflects successful completion of all required physical, psychological, and evaluative screenings, as well as authorization by a sitting member of the Board of Dominion, the highest governing body within the organization.</p>
                    <p>Your acceptance does not constitute completion of service requirements. ARCHIVE operates exclusively with personnel deemed capable of sustained performance under extreme conditions. Your selection indicates preliminary confidence in your aptitude to assist in the containment and management of anomalous phenomena. Continued placement is contingent upon demonstrable competence.</p>
                    <p>Assignment to ARCHIVE is a conditional privilege. All duties assigned to you take precedence over personal, external, or prior obligations. Failure to meet operational, ethical, or performance standards may result in immediate revocation of this privilege. Continued compliance should not be assumed.</p>

            <section class="guide-section">
                <h3>What is ARCHIVE?</h3>
                    <p>ARCHIVE is an acronym for <em>Anomalous Retention &amp; Containment Hierarchy for Irregular Violators &amp; Esoterica</em>. The organization exists to identify, secure, contain, and mitigate anomalous threats in order to preserve baseline reality and civilian populations within Robloxia.</p>
                    <p>While frequently referenced as a planetary defense organization, ARCHIVE maintains jurisdiction beyond a single world (<em>see the Universe Handbook for expanded scope definitions</em>). Anomalies may manifest as entities, locations, objects, concepts, or other irregular instances and are addressed across multiple layers of reality.</p>
                    <p>ARCHIVE is an omni-funded entity. Resources are supplied indirectly or directly by all populations under protection. All recognized world governments are signatories to unrestricted material and logistical support agreements (<em>see the Universal Protection Treaty</em>), acknowledging that uninterrupted governance is dependent on ARCHIVE operations.</p>

            <section class="guide-section">
                <h3>Anomalies</h3>
                    <p>Anomalies are defined as instances that violate established natural laws or do not follow baseline reality.</p>
                    <p>Recognized anomalous classifications include, but are not limited to: <b>Creatures</b> hosting anomalous properties or instances; <b>Places</b> exhibiting persistent or localized anomalous effects; <b>Thoughts</b>, including cognitohazards or mentally invasive entities; and <b>Objects</b> possessing anomalous behavior or attributes. Any instance not explicitly listed that demonstrates anomalous properties is to be classified accordingly.</p>
                    <p>All anomalies require specialized containment protocols and continuous monitoring. Containment procedures are documented within each anomaly’s respective containment guide.</p>
                    <p>Each anomaly is assigned four primary identification standards for documentation and database integration.</p>
                    <p><b>Instance Identity</b> consists of a chronological numerical designation corresponding to initial identification and reporting. Sub-instances are denoted by a capitalized sequential alphabetical suffix's separated by a hyphen.<br/>
                    <b>Official Terminology</b> refers to the formal designation of the anomaly, which may derive from scientific, governmental, organizational, or composite naming conventions.<br/>
                    <b>Danger Class</b> indicates the projected level of threat posed to Robloxia, ranging from Class E (minimal risk) to Class A (maximum risk).<br/>
                    <b>Containment Class</b> reflects the estimated resource expenditure required for containment, ranging from Class Epsilon (negligible) to Class Alpha (logistically or functionally uncontainable).</p>
                    <p>Additional classifications may be assigned when operationally required.</p>

                <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
                    <p>ARCHIVE personnel are organized into seven primary ranks. Each rank maintains authority over all subordinate levels. Sub-ranks denote personnel with equivalent authority operating under differing functional mandates and are considered interchangeable for command purposes.</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 7B</b> is designated for GUEST personnel (<em>see Creation Division documentation</em>). Individuals at this level possess no administrative authority and are primarily utilized for observation, testing, and exposure to hazardous anomalies under direction from Rank 5 personnel or higher.<br/>
                    <b>Rank 7A</b> personnel fulfill similar functions but consist of individuals diverted from termination or permanent sentences to the Banlands. Eligibility requires prior classification as non-hostile and non-contagious. Rank 7A is reserved for anomaly testing scenarios unsuitable for Rank 7B deployment.</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 6</b> personnel are operational staff responsible for standard facility maintenance and support roles, including sanitation, food services, electrical systems, and infrastructure repair. All Rank 6A personnel undergo mandatory exposure to Brigid Class 5 hallucinogens during induction (<em>see Creation Division documentation</em>).</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 5A</b> personnel are certified researchers authorized to document anomalies, conduct experiments, and supervise Rank 7 testing. They are assigned controlled exposure to low-risk anomalies for evaluation purposes.<br/>
                    <b>Rank 5B</b>, designated as Containment and Alignment Operational Soldiers (CAOS), are equipped with standard-issue ARCHIVE armaments, including the Automatic R5 Spreader and Nygaard Exoarmor. Personnel require a minimum of five years of Administrative Division training and are deployed based on anomaly specialization.<br/>
                    <b>Rank 5C</b> personnel are sanctum engineers and construction specialists responsible for the design and development of facilities commissioned by Rank 3 authority or higher.</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 4A</b> personnel serve as head researchers overseeing large-scale experimentation and multiple Rank 5 operations. Due to their limited numbers and strategic value, direct interaction with hazardous anomalies is strictly prohibited.<br/>
                    <b>Rank 4B</b> personnel function as operation managers overseeing coordinated teams and squadrons. Assignments are typically conducted from remote sanctums to ensure command continuity and risk mitigation.</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 3</b> personnel are sanctum overseers with full authority over facility operations, experiments, and research. They report exclusively to the Board of Dominion and Rank 1. Unauthorized dangerous action against Rank 3 personnel will result in immediate punitive response.</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 2</b>, collectively designated as the Board of Dominion, consists of division heads appointed by Rank 1. Identities are classified from all subordinate ranks. Each member exercises complete authority within their division and reports solely to Rank 1.</p>
                    <p><b>Rank 1</b> is a singular authority with unrestricted control over all ARCHIVE operations and personnel simply dubbed as "The Monitor". No additional information is available, including to the Board of Dominion.</p>
