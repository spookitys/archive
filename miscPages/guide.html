                        <p>However, this is not the end of your journey and success. As you are aware, this organzation is for the elite. Containing anomalies is no easy task, you have been selected because we believed that you possessed the neccessary skills of helping us contain the unknown, and now is your time to prove it.</p>
                        <p>Do not forget, being within this organzation is an earned privilege. Your duties are now bestowed upon you and should be an absolute priority above all else.

                        <h3>What is ARCHIVE?</h3>
                        <p> ARCHIVE is an acronym, short for Anomalous Retention & Containment Hierarchy for Irregular Violators & Esoterica. We stand to protect the people of Robloxia and contain the anomalies that invade, intrude, and threaten our world.</p>
                        <p> Despite ARCHIVE being mentioned as a world protection organzation, our scope reaches beyond just this world (<em>See the Universe Handbook for more information for details</em>). Anomalies come in many different forms, they can be people, places, objects, thoughts, ectera; and we combat and study them across multiple layers of reality.</p>
                        <p> ARCHIVE is a Omni-Funded organization, meaning that our resources are provided by all persons, directly or indirectly. All current World government have agreed to us with as many resources as we ask for (<em>See the Universal Protection Treaty</em>), as without us there would not be a world for them to govern.</p>

                        <h3>Anomalies</h3>
                        <p>Anomalies are supernatural entities, things that do not belong within this world, and that which violate the natural order of reality.</p>
                        <p>As described earlier, anomalies can be: <b>Creatures</b>, or such with anomalous instances hosted within them. <b>Places</b> that house anomalous entities or have anomalous properties connected to the place itself. <b>Thoughts</b>, this can either be specific thoughts that create an anomalous response, or creatures that attack persons with anomalous mental influence. <b>Objects</b>, which are any one inanimate instance that possess anomalous nature. Any other instances that are not explicitly listed within this page that still pertain anomalous properties will still be consider an anomaly.</p>
                        <p>Anomalies require specialized containment procedures and constant vigilance to prevent breaches and ensure the safety of all personnel and the public, each containment protocol and prodecure can be found in each anomalies respective containment guide.</p>
                        <p>Anomalies are classified with 7 properies. The first being <b>Anomaly Identity</b>, this is the most important identifier to find an anomaly within our database, each Anomaly will be numerated with a chronologically accurate number by the date they were identified and reported on. Any sub instances within the anomaly will be identified with a capitialized letter seperated by a "-" to the identifier.</p>
                        <p>(IE: The seventy-first anomaly will be listed "Anomaly #71", the first sub instance of Anomaly 71 will be listed as "Anomaly #71-A")</p>
                        <p>Sub instances are a seperate group of anomalies that are either related, contained, or within another, greater anomaly.</p>
