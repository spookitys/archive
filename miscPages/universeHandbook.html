					<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>The fundamental nature of universal structure constitutes <b>classified</b> and <b>restricted</b> information inaccessible to general Robloxian populations.
							<br/>This organization maintains exclusive custodianship of all documentation pertaining to cosmological phenomena. Primary organizational directives include the retention and suppression of all information regarding the anomalous characteristics of observable reality.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h3>Cosmology</h3>
						<p>Current organizational documentation identifies five fundamental structural components comprising observable existence.</p>
						<p>Worlds represent the most prevalent manifestation across existential strata, consisting of discrete reality subsets generated through individual creation protocols. Majority of Robloxian players have generated minimum one world instance. Standard world initialization parameters establish a 2048x2048x16 stud baseplate foundation, subject to subsequent modification by designated creator entities or authorized governing bodies maintaining jurisdictional authority over world generation.
						<p>World creation requires access to Roblox Studio, a specialized device distributed through local and superior governmental organizations for authorized population deployment. </p>
						<p>All worlds incorporate three mandatory structural elements. The first element designates the <b>World Spawn</b>, defining the materialization coordinates for all players accessing the world instance. The second element identifies <b>the Null Zone</b>, a spatial region located at extreme distance from primary world coordinates exhibiting unstable reality distortion patterns with unpredictable manifestations (refer to ARCHIVE #71 for comprehensive documentation). The third element establishes world ownership parameters; deletion or Banland sentences of the world's respective owner results in corresponding world instance deletion. All enumerated elements constitute mandatory requirements for world functionality.</p>
						<p>All world instances exist within designated <b>regional</b> boundaries. Regions constitute expansive space-time territories containing multiple world instances. Regional designation requires accompanying governmental administrative structure. Player entities maintain autonomous selection authority regarding regional construction location.</p>
                    	<p>Robloxia, alternatively designated as "the Universe," represents the comprehensive set of player-generated world instances. Robloxia incorporates a central hub facility consisting of portal arrays enabling instantaneous access to all documented world instances by any player. This central hub facility operates under the designation "Genesis." Robloxian origin parameters remain undocumented at current assessment. Prevailing theoretical framework proposes creation by superior entity maintaining absolute existential authority. Empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis remains unverified.</p>
                    	<p>Robloxia encompasses spatial volume exceeding world-occupied regions. Current documentation indicates approximately 62.11% of known Robloxian space maintains zero world presence. This unoccupied spatial classification receives designation "Hypospace" (refer to ARCHIVE #21 for detailed specifications).</p>
                    	<p>External to Robloxian boundaries exist four discrete world instances. These instances receive classification as separate "realms" due to demonstrated non-euclidean infinite spatial parameters existing within finite volumetric constraints (<em>refer to Records Division for comprehensive realm documentation</em>).<br/>No reliable or intentional access methodology to these realms currently exists. Portal infrastructure connecting realms to Robloxia remains unidentified. Current theoretical frameworks propose realm generation predating Robloxian establishment.</p>

					<h3>The Organization</h3>
						<p>Organizational design specifications address anomalous phenomena across all documented reality strata.</p>
						<p>Current facility inventory totals sixty-eight ARCHIVE installations: thirty-four facilities designated for anomaly retention operations, eleven facilities reserved for observation and detection protocols, nine facilities allocated for experimental procedures, and two facilities reserved for Board of Dominion operations and Rank 1 administrative functions.</p>
						<p>Roblox HQ, the government responsible for "Genesis" infrastructure and associated portal network systems, has authorized organizational deployment of wrist-mounted teleportation and detection devices. All personnel classified Rank 5 and superior maintain mandatory equipment protocols requiring continuous personal possession for anomaly reporting and emergency evacuation procedures.</p>
